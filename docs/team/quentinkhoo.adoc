== PROJECT: Investigapptor

---

== Overview

Investigapptor is a desktop application used for investigators to manage cases as simple, straightforward and efficient as possible.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added a *password* feature
** What it does: Allows the investigator to set a password for the Investigapptor application.
** Justification: As Investigapptor would very likely be installed on a shared computer,
                the password feature would prevent unauthorised users from accessing the
                Investigapptor application.
** Highlights: This implementation takes into consideration the importance of security. A lot
                of consideration was put into designing the password feature to cater to the
                target audience. This implementation was challenging as it requires the
                input password to always be hidden from plain sight.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** implemented automated swapping of tabs upon list command
